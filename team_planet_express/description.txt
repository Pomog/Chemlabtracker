Internet shop "Planet Express"
-"Our crew is replaceable, your package isn't!"

Our team decided to create an internet shop.
Item in the warehouse has only three parameters: name, price and available quantity.
Customer can see all the goods in the shop.
Customer has a possibility to choose an item with ordered quantity and move it from the warehouse to the shopping cart.
Shopping cart stores OrderedItems, that contain an item and ordered quantity.
Customer has a possibility to remove items from the cart.
Customer can see the list of all chosen items and see the total price for items in their cart.
Customer can finalize their shopping cart (buy without paying and/or actually getting anything).

Kickstarter goals:
1. User registration.
2. User roles (customer and admin).
3. Item descriptions.
4. Administrators ability to add and remove items from the warehouse.
5. Introduce some kind of payment system and credit card operations.
6. Notifications if items became unavailable while shopping.
7. Item categories.
8. Item search by categories.
9. Item search by full or partial names, price range, description.
